## Overview

I'm a newbie in html and css, this challenge is for me.

At first glance the design has two sections so I concentrated on that.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned to use a little more Flexbox when the page contains two sections.

I like them these css styles.

```css
.card .music {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 0rem 2rem 2rem 2rem;
  width: 100%;
}

.card {
  width: 375px;
  min-height: 550px;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  box-shadow: 0px 10px 50px -3px var(--Desaturated--blue);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue to focus in flexbox to later learn to combine it with grid and create more complex designs.
